You must show your working.","Call the rate of flow ""R "", and call the angle of turn ""T "".Use the direct proportion relationship  ,  and substitute the known corresponding values R = 14 and T = 180 from the question.Then solve to find the value of k.

[1]
Now use the equation with that value of k.Substitute in T = 135 to find the corresponding value of R.

[1]
So with the tap at 135°, the rate is 10.5 litres per minute.Now divide the size of the tank (79.8 litres) by the rate (10.5 litres/min) to find out how many minutes it will take to fill the tank.

[1]
State your conclusion. 
It will take 7.6 minutes to fill the tank.  That is longer than 7 = 7.5 minutes.  So no, it will not take less than 7 minutes to fill the tank.  [1]

","Although you do not know all of the information, sketching a graph with a rough idea of where the lines go will help you to visualise this question. It does not matter if your lines are not in the exact places but make sure that they intersect each other according to the question.

We can see from the graph that to find the area of the triangle we will need to find the values of a (the base of the triangle) and b (the perpendicular height to the base).
Find the gradient of line L1  by rearranging its equation to the form .

The formula for the area of a triangle is  where b is the base and h is the perpendicular height. Substitute the x coordinate of A and the y coordinate of B (ignoring the negative as we are looking for a height and height must be positive) into the formula.

One of the females is chosen at random.
What is the probability that this female said Spain?","In addition to the three locations, there are two kinds of people ('male' and 'female'), so use a two-way table.Start by filling in the information given in the question.  (Don't forget to include the '60 people' as the 'total total'!)

All the rows and columns in a two-way table must add up to their respective 'totals'.We can use that to find the missing numbers in the table.But we don't need to find ALL the numbers in the table, just the ones that will help us find the total number of females and how many females said Spain!

Keep working step by step towards the target.

And finally.


[1]
Then the probability we're looking for is 'Females who said Spain' divided by 'Total Females'.This is an example of conditional probability, because we are 'given that' the person chosen is female.

It doesn't matter what lengths are used- due to the properties of similarity, so long as the lengths are in the correct ratio, the angles will be correct.
So put some imaginary lengths into the diagram- it makes sense to use the simplest form of the given ratio!

To identify the angle between a line and a plane we can draw a right angled triangle using the line that is perpendicular to the plane:

We need to find angle x. Notice that we have side CF. In order to find the required angle we first need to find the length of the side AC. To do this draw a right angled triangle connecting hypotenuse AC with two sides whose lengths are known:

In triangle ABC we can use Pythagoras' Theorem to find AC.

Use the direct proportion relationship  .We want to know what happens when x is increased by 15%, however.15% increase means 'multiply by 1.15', so replace x with 1.15x in the proportion equation.Remember to put 1.15x in brackets, since that entire expression needs to be squared!.

[2]1 mark for using the direct proportion equation1 mark for using 1.15x in place of x
Now eliminate the brackets by squaring what's inside.

If x is not increased, then y is just equal to kx2.Here we have increased x by 15% and y has become equal to 1.3225 times kx2.So we need to figure out what percentage increase 1.3225 is the 'increase multiplier' for.To do this, subtract 1 from 1.3225 and then multiply by 100.

.......................years","Compound interest means a 1.5% increase each year.
However, in this case we do not know n, but we do know the value Mirek wants the investment to be worth after n years.Mirek wants £1000 interest so the amount of the investment will need to be at least
£6000 + £1000 = £7000 
Therefore we need to solve the inequality

Use of 1.015 or equivalent [1]""6000 × 1.1015n"" [1]
To solve this, use your calculator to work out the value of the investment after each year, one by one.This is an iteration method.Start by typing in 6000 to your calculator and press =/EXE so it is on the answer line and stored under the ANS key.Then type in ""ANS × 1.015"" and press EXE.  Keep doing this until the value is over £7000 - but you need to count how many times you press EXE as this will be the value of n.We recommend writing down the value after each year to help keep track.  You do not need to write all digits down and you do not need to round, it's just a way of keeping track.  You could use a tally instead.If you lose count, or are in any doubt, it is best to start again from the beginning.

To find the length of AD, you know the length of one side (CD) and the angle opposite it (CAD). You also know angle ACD so you can find the length of the side opposite that using the sine rule.
The formula for the sine rule is , where a and b are the lengths of the two sides that are opposite the angles A and B respectively.Substitute a = AD, b = 10, A = 112.5 and B = 22.5 into the formula.

First use 'there are four times as many blue discs as green discs' to write green : blue as a ratio.

[1]
'Blue' appears in both ratios, so we can use that to connect them into a single three-term ratio.To do that, the 'blue' numbers need to be the same in both ratios.So 'scale up' the G : B ratio by a factor of 3, and scale up the B : W ratio by a factor of 4.Then join the two ratios together.

[1]
Now just work out the probability as if there were 3 green, 12 blue, and 20 white counters.(Even if the numbers of counters were really 6/24/40, or 9/36/60, etc., the probability would work out the same!)In that case there would be 12 + 30 blue or white counters, and 3 + 12 + 20 counters in total.

The speed-time graph represents the first 12 seconds of the run.

After how many seconds had the horse run a distance of 75 metres?
.........................seconds","Method 1
In a speed-time graph, the area under the graph is the distance.
Start by finding the distance during the first 4 seconds, which is on the graph is in the shape of a triangle. Area of triangle.

area of triangle
[1]
                = 20
The distance remaining to reach 75 metres is;
75 − 20 = 55 metres
From 4 seconds onwards, the graph is a rectangle so area = length × height. The area needed is 55, the height is 10 and we need the length marked  on the diagram that gives 55. (Note that although it's marked on the diagram between 9 and 10, this is a guess and we don't actually know yet where it will be). 

[1]
So the total time to reach 75 metres is the first 4 seconds plus another 5.5 seconds. 
total time = 4 + 5.5 = 9.5 seconds
9.5 seconds [1] Method 2
In a speed-time graph, the area under the graph is the distance.
This graph is in the shape of a trapezium and area of a trapezium  where  and  are the parallel lines and  is the height.

In the diagram above, the longer parallel length has been called . Note that although it's marked on the diagram between 10 and 11, we don't actually know yet where it will be- it's marked on the diagram for demonstration purposes only. The trick to this question is to find the value of  that gives an area of 75.
The smaller parallel length becomes   and the height , , is 10. Substitute these into the trapezium formula and equate to 75.

Prove that .","To prove that ST  is equal to UT  you will need to prove that the triangle STU is isosceles. This can be done by finding the angles. 
PQRST is a regular pentagon, so the angle TSU is the exterior angle of a regular pentagon.Exterior angles in any polygon add up to 360°.A regular pentagon has 5 equal exterior angles.
 
[1]
To find the size of angle SUT, you will need to consider circle theorems.
Begin by joining the point O to the points T and R, marking all the radiuses of the circle as equal lengths on the diagram.
TP and TR are also tangents to the circle, so by the circle theorem 'A tangent always meets a radius at 90°', angles ORQ and OTP are both 90°.

Mark these onto the diagram.

The sum of the interior angles in any polygon can be found using the formula 180°(n - 2).A regular pentagon has 5 equal interior angles, therefore these can be found using the formula .
 
Add these angles to the diagram.

PQROT  is a pentagon, so the angle ROT  can be found by subtracting the other four angles from the sun of the angles in a pentagon.
The sum of the interior angles in any polygon can be found using the formula 180°(n - 2).

Substitute in the angles you know to find angle ROT.

By the circle theorem, the angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference, angle ROT is twice angle RUT.

If she sells a microwave that is faulty then Lily must pay for its repair and redelivery. This costs her another £25 for each faulty microwave.
Last month, 6 out of the 80 microwaves Lily sold were faulty.
This month she has orders for 133 microwaves.
Calculate her expected percentage profit on this month’s order. Showing your working in the boxes below may help you present your work.



Expected number of faulty microwaves:
Expected costs:


Income from sales:
Expected percentage profit:



............................%","Use the information in the boxes as guidance on how to complete this question.
First, find the expected number of faulty microwaves.
 Find 6 out of 80 as a percentage - this is the percentage of the 80 microwaves from last month that were faulty and the same percentage can be used to estimate how many of this months' will be.

[1]
Find 7.5% of 133.

So she can expect 10 microwaves to be faulty (rounding to the nearest microwave).
[1]
Second, find the expected costs.
Remember that each microwave costs £32 to buy and £7 to deliver so this is £39 of costs in total for each microwave.
Costs for all microwaves = 133 × £39 = £5187
Find the costs for the expected 10 faulty microwaves.
Costs for faulty microwaves = 10 × £25 = £250
Find the total costs by adding them together.
Total costs = £5187 + £250 = £5437
[1]
 Third, find the income from sales.
She sells 133 microwaves at £60 each.
133 × £60 = £7980
[1]
Finally, find the expected percentage profit.
Find the actual profit by subtracting the total costs from the total income from sales.
Profit =  £7980 - £5437 = £2543
Find the profit as a percentage of the total costs by dividing the profit by the costs and then multiplying by 100. 

 [1]
Round the final answer to 3 significant figures.




Expected number of faulty microwaves:




Expected costs:
133 × £39 = £5187
10 × £25 = £250
£5187 + £250 = £5437




Income from sales:
133 × £60 = £7980

So there are 6 black socks, and 11 socks in total.With combined probabilities, 'and' usually means 'multiply'.'Takes two black socks' is the same as 'takes a black sock (6/11) AND then takes another black sock (5/10)'.(Note that after taking the first black sock, only 5 black socks and 10 socks in total remain.  So the numerator and denominator of the second probability fraction have to change.)Therefore multiply those two fractions together to find the probability.

The ratio
number of pink sweets : number of white sweets = 2 : 1
There are 28 red sweets in the bag.Work out the number of white sweets in the bag.","The probability of taking a red sweet is the number of red sweets in the bag divided by the total number of sweets in the bag. Call the total number of sweets in the bag ""N "".Then you can set up an equation and solve to find the value of N.

[1]
Now use the fact that all probabilities must sum up to 1.This means that the probability of pink OR white must be equal to 1 minus the probabilities for green and red.

[1]
The ratio of the number of pink and white sweets is the same as the ratio of the probabilities of taking pink or white.Add the pink : white ratio numbers together. This gives the total number of 'parts' that the ratio divides 0.45 (the pink OR white probability) into.Then divide 0.45 by that sum to find out how much probability is in one part.
      
[1]
So there is a probability of 0.15 in each part.White sweets have one part of the ratio, so the probability of getting a white sweet is 0.15.We also know from above that there are 80 sweets in the bag in total.
Call the number of white sweets ""W "".The probability of getting a white sweet is the number of white sweets divided by the total number of sweets in the bag.Use this information to set up and solve an equation for W.

The radius of B is smaller than the radius of A. To go from the big shape to the small shape, put the small length on top in the fraction so that k will be smaller than 1

Finding k using  , if you put the larger length on top of the fraction then;

Notice that k > 1 so multiplying by k will make the length bigger- but in going from the radius of A to the radius of B, we want to go from a longer length to a smaller length. So divide by k instead

lower quartile = 20 
The upper quartile is the  value (the 12th value) 
upper quartile = 29

In 6 hours the 15 machines will have completed 15 × 6 'machine hours' of the work.Subtract that from 120 to see how many 'machine hours' are left to complete.

So there are 30 'machine hours' of work left to do.After 3 machines break down, there will be 15 - 3 = 12 machines left to complete the work.Divide 30 by 12 to see how long it will take the remaining 12 machines to complete the work.

Speed (s mph)
Number ofvehicles
Midpoint
Frequency × Midpoint



5
10
5 × 10 = 50



8

8 × 30 = 240

37 × 45 = 1665



47
55
47 × 55 = 2585



3
70
3 × 70 = 210



 
Midpoints [1]Frequency × Midpoints [1]
Now find the sum of the Frequency × Midpoint column, this is equivalent to the speeds of every vehicle added up
50 + 240 + 1665 + 2585 + 210 = 4750
Divide this by the total number of vehicles, which is the sum of the Number of Vehicles column
Total vehicles = 5 + 8 + 37 + 47 + 3 = 100
Mean =

47.5 mph [1]

ii)  
We cannot know the exact value of the mean as the data is grouped; for example the 5 vehicles in the  group could be 5 vehicles at 1mph, or 5 at 20 mph, or an even spread throughout the group. When we use the midpoint, we are assuming the data is evenly spread through the group; which it may not be. [1]",6-statistics,

In total, the flight lasted 2 hours.Work out the value of .","At first, this looks like it could be very complicated and involved the relationship between distance, speed and time.However, we are given the total time of the flight, so we only need be concerned with the time entries from the table.
The sum of the two times for each stage of the flight will be 2.Use this to set up an equation involving algebraic fractions.

[1]
To begin solving this equation, we first need to make a common denominator for the fractions on the left-hand side.The lowest common denominator (lcd) will be found by multiply x by (x - 24).
lcd of x and (x - 24) is x(x - 24)
Now write the left-hand side of the equation such that both fractions have the same denominator; the first will need both numerator and denominator multiplying by (x - 24); the second will need both multiplying by x.

[1]
Now the left-hand side can be written as a single fraction.Expand the bracket and simplify the numerator.

Now bring in the right-hand side of the equation.To remove the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by its denominator (x(x - 24)).

Expand the brackets and rearrange to form a quadratic equation.

[1]
If you spot it, divide through by 2 to make the values smaller and easier to work with.

This does factorise!  But as the values are awkward you may find it easier to use the quadratic formula.

[1]
Looking at the speed column, x = 17 would give a negative speed for the 2nd stage of the flight.This is nonsense, so reject the answer x = 17.

Only A and B have a shared factor of 3, B contains 31 and A contains 35 so we can put 31 into the overlap between A and B (but not in C), and then 34 into the ""only A"" section

Only A and C have a shared factor of 5, so there must be a power of 5 in the overlapping region between A and C (but not in B). A only contains 51, so we can place 51 in the overlapThe LCM of A and C contains 52, so the remaining 5 must be in the ""only C"" section

All three of A, B, C contain a factor of 7, so there must be a power of 7 in the centreThe HCF of B and C only contains 71, so the power of 7 in the centre of the diagram will be 71

A contains a factor of 73, so needs two more 7sB contains a factor of 74, so needs three more 7sThis means we can put a 72 in the overlap between A and B, and then the remaining 7 in the ""only B"" section

To find the length of one arc, use the formula for the circumference of a circle, , divided by 4.It is best t leave your working in terms of  as you go. 
 
[1]
There are four arcs, so the four curved corners can be found by multiplying the answer by 4. Note that this could be done in one step by noticing that the arcs formed by the four quadrants are equivalent to one full circumference of a pencil!
Curved sections =

Sam has assumed that the three people will be working for 24 hours straight putting letters into envelopes.  This is not reasonable because 'working all day' does not usually mean 'working for 24 hours'.  [1]

Prove that .","To prove that ST  is equal to UT  you will need to prove that the triangle STU is isosceles. This can be done by finding the angles. 
PQRST is a regular pentagon, so the angle TSU is the exterior angle of a regular pentagon.Exterior angles in any polygon add up to 360°.A regular pentagon has 5 equal exterior angles.
 
[1]
To find the size of angle SUT, you will need to consider circle theorems.
Begin by joining the point O to the points T and R, marking all the radiuses of the circle as equal lengths on the diagram.
TP and TR are also tangents to the circle, so by the circle theorem 'A tangent always meets a radius at 90°', angles ORQ and OTP are both 90°. 
 (angle between tangent and radius)
[1]
Mark these onto the diagram.

The sum of the interior angles in any polygon can be found using the formula 180°(n - 2).A regular pentagon has 5 equal interior angles, therefore these can be found using the formula .
 
Add these angles to the diagram.

PQROT  is a pentagon, so the angle ROT  can be found by subtracting the other four angles from the sun of the angles in a pentagon.
The sum of the interior angles in any polygon can be found using the formula 180°(n - 2).

Substitute in the angles you know to find angle ROT.

[1]
By the circle theorem, the angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference, angle ROT is twice angle RUT.

As the scale factor is between 0 and 1, the shape should be smaller and closer to the centre of enlargement.Choose a corner and find the displacement from the centre to this corner. Starting at this corner count the distance of each side around the shape. You can ignore one of the diagonal sides as this can be made by joining together the two corners.Multiply each length/displacement by the scale factor. Starting at the centre use the new displacement to find the position of the new corner. Then use the new lengths to draw the enlarged shape.To check your answer you can draw a straight line going through the centre and a corner of the original shape, the corresponding corner on the enlarged shape should also lie on this line.[1]Find the area of the new triangle using the formula , where b is the base and h is the perpendicular height.[1]Area = 1.5 cm2 [1]

267422,"Gemma says   The equation (2x + 1)(3x + 2) + x (3x + 5) + 2 = -12 has no solutions.Explain Gemma’s reasoning.

",Error in response,"Gemma believes that the equation (2x + 1)(3x + 2) + x (3x + 5) + 2 = -12 has no solutions. Here's her reasoning:

First, she applies the distributive property to simplify the equation. The equation becomes 6x^2 + 4x + 3x + 2 + 3x^2 + 5x + 2 = -12.

Next, she combines like terms. The equation simplifies to 9x^2 + 12x + 4 = -12.

Then, she moves all terms to one side of the equation, so it becomes 9x^2 + 12x + 4 + 12 = 0.

After that, she adds the constant terms to simplify the equation to 9x^2 + 12x + 16 = 0.

Lastly, Gemma notes that this equation is a quadratic equation in standard form and it does not factorize or have any real solutions. Therefore, she concludes that there are no solutions to this equation."

295888,"Method 1(This is the expected method and answer)The curve has been translated 6 to the right. Remember that when translating in the x-axis, + a units in the x direction leads to y = f(x – a)y = f(x – 6) [1]Answer must include ""y = ..."" to achieve the mark

Method 2You should recognise the curve as a quadratic graph. The minimum point is at (4, 0) so the graph takes the form y = a(x − 4)2Pick another integer point, for example (3, 1) and substitute into y = a(x − 4)2, and solve to find a1 = a(3 − 4)21 = a(− 1)2a = 1Thereforey = (x − 4)2 [1]Note that this is not the expected method or answer- but it is equally valid

Method 2 Using a tableSet up a table of values as below. You don't have to include every integer between −2 and 4, but you should include at least three valuesUse the TABLE application of your calculator to complete the table, using f(x) = x + 5, starting at -2 and ending at 4. If your calculator doesn't have a TABLE application, substitute x values y = x + 5 to find the y valuesat least 2 correct y-values found by substituting x [1]Plot the points on the grid. For example the first column of the table represents the point (−2, 4)at least 2 points correctly plotted [1]Using a ruler or straight edge, draw a straight line through the points, from x = −2 to x = 4fully correct line [1]

ii)Draw a line between the hall and the post office on the map. The bearing from the post office to the hall will be bigger than 180. You can either measure it directly using a full 360 protractor. Otherwise you can find the reverse bearing (from the hall to the post office) and then add 180.152 + 180332° [1]Answers in the range 330 to 334 are accepted

Find the difference, halve it and subtract it from 18 000.Lower bound = 18 000 - 500 = 17 500Check that the lower bound would round to 18 000.Minimum possible number is 17 500 [1]

ii)19 000 is what numbers would round to after 18 000. The upper bound will be the halfway point between 18 000 and 19 000. Find the difference, halve it and add it to 18 000.Upper bound = 18 000 + 500 = 18 500Check that the upper bound would round to 18 000. Although it is the upper bound it would round to 19 000. Numbers such as 18 499.999 would still round to 18 000 however the number of people needs to be an integer. So choose the largest integer that is less than the upper bound.Maximum possible number is 18 499 [1]
